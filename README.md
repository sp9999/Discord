Quote bot where you add quotes to a database. 
* Quotes can be invoked from the database via @bot or !wb command ("wb" legacy from welcome back irc bot days). 
* Quotes can be set on a timer to broadcast a quote into a specific channel
* Excuse generator (requires channel to populate excuse patterns for full effect)
